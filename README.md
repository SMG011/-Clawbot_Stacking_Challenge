# -Clawbot_Stacking_Challenge

# Build overview:
This assignment's overview is to build and program a robot (Clawbot) to pick up and stack 3D-printed cubes all by itself. The tower must stay standing for 10 seconds after the last cube is placed on the stack. The goal is to make the tallest stack that stays standing without falling over!

# Port assignments 
- **Brain:** Connected to all motors and used to run the code

# What your code does 
The robot drives to the cubeâ€™s location using programmed commands. It lowers the arm and closes the claw to grab the cube. Then, it lifts the cube, takes a 180 degree turn, and then drives to the stacking zone. The robot lowers the arm and opens the claw to place the cube gently on the stack. It repeats the process to stack more cubes all done using the coded program (without us touching it after starting the program).

# Reflection on what worked / what was hard 
**What worked:**
The claw was able to grab the cubes tightly without dropping them.

The robot could stack two cubes successfully without the tower falling.

The code ran smoothly, and the robot moved accurately to each cube location.

**What Was Hard:**
Getting the claw to line up perfectly with the cubes was tricky.

Making sure the cubes stayed stable when stacked took a lot of testing.

Timing the arm and claw movement in the code so it didn't drop cubes was challenging.
