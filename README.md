# -Clawbot_Stacking_Challenge

# Build overview:
This assignment's overview is to build and program a robot (Clawbot) to pick up and stack 3D-printed cubes all by itself. The tower must stay standing for 10 seconds after the last cube is placed on the stack. The goal is to make the tallest stack that stays standing without falling over!

# Port assignments 
- **Brain:** Connected to all motors and used to run the code
- The drivetrain is ports 10 and 6
- The arm is port 3
- The claw is port 4

# What your code does 
The robot drives to the cubeâ€™s location using programmed commands. It lowers the arm and closes the claw to grab the cube. Then, it lifts the cube, takes a 180 degree turn, and then drives to the stacking zone. The robot lowers the arm and opens the claw to place the cube gently on the stack. It repeats the process to stack more cubes all done using the coded program (without us touching it after starting the program).

# Reflection on what worked / what was hard 
**What Worked:**

The claw successfully gripped the cubes tightly without dropping them.

We had no problems occur in making the clawbot.

Communication and teamwork helped us solve problems quickly during testing.

Everyone in the group contributed and stayed engaged throughout the process.

The arm and claw coordination improved after a few tests.

**What Was Challenging:**

Aligning the claw perfectly with the cubes was tricky and required careful adjustments.

Keeping the cubes stable while stacking them took a lot of testing and fine-tuning.

Timing the movements of the arm and claw in the code was difficult and led to a few dropped cubes.

Initially, our code was reversed, so we had to revise and improve it to function correctly.

Getting the angles just right was hard because the arm would either overturn or underturn.
